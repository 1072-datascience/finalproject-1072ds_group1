-------------------------------------------
I want to share my profile with people who couldn't do what they really like
because of the education system in Taiwan.

Econ in JHU is a very small dept and some would say it's not very impressive in
terms of ranking. But it's one of my favourite since they have good
structural IO, micro-econometrics and macro faculty. Its location is also of
good advantage for those who want to pursue a career in an organisation in
DC. I'm really satisfied.

Thanks God. And the credits goes to my parents and my professors in UIUC,
especially Prof Loeb of math dept, Prof Bera, Prof Esfahani, Prof Perry of
econ dept and Dr Kolodziej of CGS. They have all of my gratitude.
